## TASK MANAGER USING MVC. 

In this small project we focus on the basics of MVC. This was taken from a class of the course i'm doing. 

The point is to do a basic manager of tasks which show the tasks in the console. The tasks can be completed and our system needs to reflect that when the tasks are shown.
